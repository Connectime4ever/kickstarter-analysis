# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
### Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends bringing some insights, for the playwright of the play "Fever", about the relationship between the launch date of a play and its outcomes, and the funding goals set for a campaign and its outcomes. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
- It is recommended the play launch date is picked from May to July preferably. These months show the highest successful rates (***above 80%***).
- Launches in February, April and August tend to have the same successfull rate around mid 70%. They might be options to consider.
- In the event the play has to be launched in the last quarter of the year, October seems to be the preferable month to pick. However, this month also shows the highest failed rate. 
- It is advised to **avoid** launch dates from November to January following year.

### Limitations of this dataset

#### As this dataset is only for one year we are not sure if it is showing a fair seasonality. We would need to look into the trend of other years to be sure that the seasonality is consistent and extraordinary situations affecting the monthly performance can be discarted. 


### Other possible tables/graph going more in depth in the analysis.
