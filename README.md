# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
### Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends bringing some insights, for the playwright of the play "Fever", about the relationship between the launch date of a play and its outcomes and the funding goals set for a campaign and its outcome.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
- The playwright should try to launch the play any month from May to July preferably. 
- To avoid lauch dates from November to January following year. 
- Launches in February, April and August tend to have the same successfull rate.
- The worst month to pick a launch date seems to be December, followed by November and January.
- In event the play has to be launch in the last quater of the year October seems to be the preferable month to pick. However, this month also show the highest failed rate. 

### Limitations of this dataset

#### As this dataset is only for one year we do not know we are not sure if it shows a fair seasonality.  There might be some extraordinary situations affecting the performance based the launch dates in the year of this dataset that might be distorting the seasonality pattern.  We would need to look at the trend of other years too. 

### Other possible tables/graph going more in depth in the analysis.
